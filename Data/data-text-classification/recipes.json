Electric kettles are fast and convenient.\nIf infusing a pot of tea, pour some hot tap water into your teapot and let stand for about several seconds to a minute to pre-warm it. Alternately, you can swish some of the hotter boiling water from your kettle around in the teapot for a few seconds. Pour out this water before adding the tea to the teapot.\nIf using loose tea, prepare the tea\nCommonly one-half to one tea measure (or rounded teaspoon if you do not have a tea measure) is added per desired cup of tea. Some people add an extra measure \"for the pot\" (e.g., if 4 cups of tea are desired, 5 measures of tea would be used. It really is a matter of personal preference.)\nIf you are using an infuser, be sure it is closed tightly so the tea does not spill into the pot. Rinse the tea-filled infuser briefly under cool tap water to wash away tiny flakes that would otherwise drift into the teapot.\nIf using a filter basket infuser, do not overfill the basket (refer to the instructions that came with your basket). The brief rinse is usually not necessary unless the basket's mesh is quite porous.\nSimply dropping loose tea into the teapot is also an option, though you may want to strain the tea as you pour it into the cups.\nPlace the tea or tea bag into the teapot.\nWhen the water reaches the preferred temperature (see note below), pour it from the tea kettle into the teapot or single-serving teacup. As you pour, try to avoid pouring directly onto the tea (especially important for green and white teas) to avoid scalding the leaves.\nAllow the tea to infuse quietly (i.e., do not stir the teapot or \"dunk the teabag\"). Agitating the tea releases more of the bitter compounds and degrades the taste. Watch the time to avoid over-infusion (see note below), and remove the infuser or tea bag when the time is up. If you did not use an infuser or tea bag, pour the tea into cups for immediate consumption.\nRemember that the tannins in tea stain, so it is advisable to pour the tea over a non-staining surface, wipe up any spills quickly, and do not leave tea standing in a teapot for long periods of time.", "Adding sweeteners and lemon or milk", " Tea bags are convenient, but tea purists often despise them", "Generally, green and white teas need no sweetener or milk added to them for a delicious taste if prepared properly. Some research indicates that adding lemon to green tea may make some of the healthful compounds in the tea more easily available to the body, and it provides a different, fresh taste to the tea.\nLemon lightens the color of tea and may accentuate any bitterness in the tea\nLemon pairs well with citrus-flavored teas, such as the bergamot-enhanced \"Grey\" teas (e.g., Earl Grey, Lady Grey, etc.), and unflavored black teas. Milk pairs well with sweet, flowery, or \"fruity\" teas, or with any black tea in which you wish to reduce bitterness.\nNever combine milk and lemon in the same cup of tea or the milk will curdle into lumps.\nAlways add sweeteners to tea before adding any milk; otherwise, the milk will cool the tea, and the sweetener will not dissolve properly. For better dissolving, it is preferable to add several small amounts of sweetener to the tea, stirring each time, rather than adding a large amount of sweetener at once.\nChai teas by definition require the addition of milk, ranging from one-fourth to one-half of the total volume, and a sweetener. The milk may be warmed if serving hot chai. Otherwise, cold milk and ice cubes make a lovely iced chai."]}, "Ambrosia Fruit Salad": {"Ingredients": ["4 cups of mandarin oranges drained\n2 cans of pineapple drained\n6-8 cups miniature marshmallows\n3 cups whipping cream"], "Procedure": ["Mix the mandarin oranges and grapes, fruit cocktail, in a large bowl.\nFold in the whipped cream, sour cream and marshmallows.\nChill for at least an hour.\nStir again before serving."]}, "Red Bean Paste (Anko)": {"Ingredients": ["3 \u2154 oz (110 g) Japanese red beans (azuki)\n5 \u2153 oz (150 g) granulated sugar\n1 tablespoons starch syrup, for shining\na dash salt", "Ingredients[edit]", "(Enough for 16 buns)\n", "1\u00bc oz package active dry yeast (2\u00bc teaspoons)\n1 teaspoon granulated sugar\n1 cup lukewarm water (40-45\u00b0C)\n3 cups all-purpose flour (reserve 1 tablespoon if mixing by hand)"], "Procedure": ["Wash the beans well.\nIn a large sauce pan, put the beans and fill the 14 oz/400 ml water or the amount filled over the beans.

A 10kg ham is considered better-tasting as the pig has gotten bigger.\nBefore putting the ham in the oven, take it out from the refrigerator and let come closer to room temperature. If you intend to put the ham in the oven in the evening, take it out during the early morning. The ham should be about 10 degrees C (50 F)  when you put it in the oven.\nUse a wet paper towel to clean the ham a bit; then dry it.\nPlace ham on baking tray in oven, with some water on the tray. Or, if you have a large roasting bag, there is no need for water.\nNote: do not use only the grill as it lets drop all the liquid from the ham, messing up your oven if the roasting bag fails. However, you can use the grill and put the ham on it and baking tray beneath that. An aluminum foil can also be used on the baking tray.\nPreheat oven to 200\u00a0\u00b0C (you can skip this if you are not worried about the possible bacteria on the ham) and let ham roast in the warm oven for half an hour, then turn temperature down.\nCook at 100-125\u00a0\u00b0C, for about 1 hour/kilo, so a 7 kg ham will take 7 hours or more, until meat thermometer shows 75-80\u00a0\u00b0C. 'Traditional' ham is ready at 80\u00a0\u00b0C but most take the ham out of the oven at 77\u00a0\u00b0C or so, when the ham has more water left in it and is considered tastier.\nThe use of a meat thermometer is recommended because the actual temperature of an oven commonly varies from its setting; thus the ham can be severely under- or overcooked if you do not use a thermometer. Thermometer should be placed in the middle of the ham. Be careful that it does not touch the oven walls. You can test if the thermometer works properly before using it by dipping it in boiling water - it should show about 100\u00a0\u00b0C.\nAfter you take the ham out of the oven, wait a little while before removing the thermometer. It is recommended you do not pour the liquid from the bag or baking tray down the drain.\nWait until ham is cool enough to handle, then glaze it with mustard and breadcrumbs. First remove the rind from the ham, then cover the ham with mustard, then with breadcrumbs. Put in 250\u00a0\u00b0C oven for 10 minutes.\nHam is ready to eat when it has cooled down a bit. This makes about enough for 3 or 4 people for a week, but if you think you will not eat it all within a week, freeze the rest."]}, "Chuu Chee Fish": {"Ingredients": ["650g whole bream or similar fish\n1 metric cup vegetable oil (reserve 1 tablespoon for stir-frying curry paste)\n1 teaspoon of kaeng chu chee curry paste\n6 dried Kaffir lime leaves\n1 metric cup coconut milk\n1 tablespoon (warning: perhaps the metric 20 mL one) of fish sauce\n1 teaspoon sugar\nfresh cilantro\n1 fresh red chili pepper"], "Procedure": ["In a wok or large frypan, over high heat, fry fish using most of the vegetable oil, until golden on one side.

(optional)\n1 packet of dry winemaker's yeast (Lalvin EC1118, K1V1116 or similar) as well as yeast nutrient."], "Procedure": ["Some mead makers prefer to create a starter culture by preparing a mixture of one cup of room temperature sanitized fruit juice and the freeze dried winemaking yeast and placing it into a smaller one quart sanitized container fitted with a rubber stopper and airlock for a day or two until the mixture is bubbling. This container is kept at room temperature out of direct sunlight. This starter culture will cause the fermentation below to begin with vigor and may prevent the mead from failing to ferment.\n", "Honey is slowly added to a large pot half-full with water while heating. There is a common disagreement among mead makers as to whether you should boil the honey or not; mead makers have had success with either method. Boiling will alter the flavor, but will enhance the clarity of the finished mead. As the mead is heated over medium heat, it will nearly boil after the honey has been completely dissolved.\n", "After a time of heating the honey (which helps it dissolve and can also pasteurize it), the mixture is cooled to between (170\u00b0F/76\u00b0C) and (140\u00b0F/60\u00b0C) and the raisins are added. The mixture continues to cool, then is transferred to the carboy. Once it has cooled to room temperature (68\u00b0F/20\u00b0C), yeast which has been rehydrated is added to the honey/water mixture (must) and the airlock is put on. After being placed in a cool (68\u00b0F/20\u00b0C), dark place for a few hours or a day, the airlock should start to allow bubbles to escape. This is waste carbon dioxide (CO2) and shows that the yeast is processing the sugar into alcohol. The raisins rise to the surface of the fermenting mixture. If they block the airlock, the mead maker will have to rack. Stirring or agitating the mixture is avoided, as it may cause the liquid to rise up and spill out of the airlock.\n", "After a four to six week period the mead maker may want to rack the mead into a second sanitized carboy. An airlock is not necessary during primary (aerobic) fermentation. This racking will clear out the lees and allow the mead to clear faster. The mead is siphoned into the second carboy via a sanitized tube, usually filled it with sterile water to start the siphon. The mead is siphoned carefully to avoid splashing as excess oxygen at this point may cause an unpleasant taste in the final product. An airlock is placed on the second carboy. It is imperative that sterile conditions be maintained while the carboys are open to avoid infection. The mead is racked in another 3 months or when all signs of fermentation have stopped (usually when the airlock doesn't produce any bubbles for a long period of time\u2014typically over 30 seconds between bubbles) and your mead has cleared. Excessive racking will promote oxidation, resulting in an undrinkable mead. The carboy is clear enough when it is possible to read a newspaper through it. The mead will then need to age, usually one year, and anywhere up five or more. Bulk aging can be done done in a tertiary carboy, but bottle aging is also common.\n", "Then next step is to bottle the mead. Mead is generally sealed in sanitized bottles using airtight caps or quality corks. If the fermentation is not complete, pressure will build up inside the sealed bottles and cause them to explode. Mead is generally aged for at least 6 months in the bottle before drinking.\n", "\n\n\n\nWikipedia has related information at Mead\n\n", "This module uses text from the Wikipedia module Mead under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License.

Add the onion to the pan and fry over a very low heat until caramelized, stirring frequently to prevent them burning. The onions must be browned, not translucent, to get the authentic flavour. This will take at least fifteen minutes. If you want to save time, you can do as many Pakistani cooks do and use the ready-fried onions that can be bought in large bags in Asian supermarkets (or in small, expensive pots sold as \"crispy salad onions\" in English supermarkets).

Cook for 25 minutes and do not remove the lid.\nAfter 25 minutes, remove the lid, add the peas, cover with a clean teatowel (optional) and replace the lid. Turn off the heat and leave to rest for five minutes; the peas will cook in the residual heat and the teatowel will absorb excess moisture/condensation.\nTurn out onto a serving platter (separate large lumps by pressing with the back of a spoon) or plate up.
